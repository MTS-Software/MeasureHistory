That is allowed by default on MySQL.

What is disabled by default is remote root access. If you want to enable that, run this SQL command locally:

 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;
 FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
And then find the following line and comment it out in your my.cnf file, which usually lives on /etc/mysql/my.cnf on Unix/OSX systems. If it's a Windows system, you can find it in the MySQL installation directory, usually something like C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5\ and the filename will be my.ini.

Change line

 bind-address = 127.0.0.1
to

 #bind-address = 127.0.0.1
And restart the MySQL server (Unix/OSX, and Windows) for the changes to take effect.
